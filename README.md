How to Use
1. Add Muscle Groups and Exercises
   Before creating a workout, you'll need to define muscle groups and exercises. Navigate to the plugin menu, and under the "Muscle Groups" section, you can add the primary muscle groups you'll be working on. Once you've added muscle groups, define exercises within those groups.

2. Create a Workout
   Go to the "Workouts" tab and select "Create New Workout".
   Add exercises from your pre-defined list and customize sets, repetitions, or time-based activities.
   Save your workout to log future progress.
3. Track Progress
   Each workout you complete is logged, and you can view stats for each exercise over time. This helps you understand your improvement in terms of strength and endurance.

4. View Heatmap
   The Heatmap feature gives you a quick overview of your workout frequency and intensity. Use this to gauge your consistency and track high-intensity periods.
